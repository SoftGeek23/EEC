EEC Cache simulator project

To run this project, download or clone the project, cd into the Traces directory. Make sure Traces is the root directory. To run the simulator:

1. Install python if you don't have it already. (pip install python3)
2. Then give the run.sh file executable permissions in the terminal(chmod +x run.sh)
3. Then, run ./run.sh in the terminal
4. View output results in an output.txt file in the directory. 

The output is constructed by looping through each trace file and testing the traces with the different associativity levels(2,4,8) and outputting the results.
